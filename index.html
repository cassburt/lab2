        <h2><em>writer / author / designer</em></h2>
          <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Born in Indiana, Cass got the hell out as soon as possible.<br>
              He first went abroad, teaching in Italy, the Czech Republic, and Poland before finding his way to sunny California.<br>
              After a short stint as a script writer and project manager for the Mighty Mighty Morphing Power Rangers guy (don't ask),<br>
              he finally landed his dream job when he was offered a position managing the University of Oregon's Midwestern Study Abroad Consortia.<br>
              He oversaw enrollment, communication, strategy, and even built their <a href="http://geo.uoregon.edu">current website</a> (a project he loved even if he totally cheated by using a CMS).<a</p>
            <p>Then his academic unit (of which his program was a part) went bust.</p>
            <p>Luckily, however, a new and interesting (if odd) offer came along - a chance to write a paid biography of a union boss who ran Illinois labor for 40 years.<br>
              Intrigued - and more importantly <strong>unemployed</strong> - Cass said yes.</p>
            <p>And so, here we are.</p>
            <p>Now in his third (and final) year of the book, Cass is beginning to worry about what comes next.<br>
              He is so worried that he has begun to write about himself in third person.<br>
              He is hoping this program <em>might</em> hold the key...</p>
