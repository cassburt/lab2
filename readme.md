Project Steps

Create a local home for my project
1. Open terminal
2. Enter mkdir repos (oops! Wrong name. So, mv repos Repos)

Clone my project to my local computer
3. Go to github and copy the project link (lab2)
4. In terminal, type git clone [link] (oops! Cloned directly to home. So rm -rf lab2, followed by
cd Repos  followed by git clone [link].)

Create a new branch & push it to Github
5. In terminal, type git checkout -b N3_submit, followed by git push origin N3_submit

Additional Work
6. Uppercase / Lowercase added
7. Correct answer counter added
